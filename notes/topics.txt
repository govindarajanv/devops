	-	diff between SOAP and Restful
		-	SOAP
			-	protocol
			-	cant use REST as it is a protocol
			-	uses services interface to expose business logic
			-	standards are to be strictly followed
			-	requires more bandwidth
			-	uses XML format only
		-	Restful
			-	architectural style
			-	can use SOAP as it is a concept and can use protocols like http, soap etc
			-	uses URI to expose business logic
			-	requires less bandwidth
-	OS
	-	Diff between process, thread and service
		-	process is a software that is running on a system  (e.g) grep
			service publishes methods to access them, so other programs can call them and get their service (e.g) tomcat
			Services are processes, often started when the system starts up, that run in the background in order to provide some additional functionality.
			These are often called daemons (pronounced like demon) and provide facilities such as SSH, email and automatic mounting of disks.
